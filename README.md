The Battle of the Neighborhoods-Vegan Restaurants in New York City

Project Motivation and Background

New York City:

New York City is one of the most populous cities in the world. With an estimated population of over 8 million people and over 65 million visitors in 2018, New York is very diverse and has many different offerings for it's many tourists and residents. New York City has over 24,000 restaurants, of many different varieties and cuisines,with approximately 10,000 located in Manhattan alone.

Vegan/Vegetarian Restaruants:

Vegan and vegetarian diets have grown significantly in popularity in the last few years. Many people may choose to follow plant based diets for a variety of different reasons, such as concern for animal welfare, positive health benefits or environmental concerns. There are currently over 9 million Americans who adhere to a plant based diet and many of those people will inevitably travel to locations around the world and will look for places to eat that may accommodate dietary needs. In 2018, the global vegan food market was estimated to be over $12 billion, which shows that there is a definate market for plant based foods around the world.

Target Audience:

The audience for this project could be either a person or company looking to open a plant based restaurant, or a tourist coming to NYC and looking to find plant based food options while there. As seen above, with a number of visitors coming to New York City each year and with a significant number of Americans now adhering to plant based diets, there could certainly be a market for vegan or vegetarian cuisine in New York.
